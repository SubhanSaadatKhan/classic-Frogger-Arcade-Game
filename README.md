# Frogger Arcade Game

## Features

- Ground Section: Filled with moving cars (in white), trucks (in red). Watch out for cars and trucks that can end your journey! As the level increases, the speed of the cars and trucks increases, making it more challenging to avoid them.
- Safe Zone: This area is free of obstacles. Take a rest before continuing your journey!
- Water Section: Leap onto moving logs (in brown) and turtles (in yellow) to avoid drowning. You can also leap onto crocodiles (in green), but do not land on the head of the crocodile or when turtles are submerged underwater. The speed of the logs and turtles also increase with each level, making it harder to navigate this section.
